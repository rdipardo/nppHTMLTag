h2. Introduction

This plug-in provides three core functions to Notepad++:
* HTML and XML tag jumping, like the built-in brace matching (Ctrl+B / Shift+Ctrl+B), and selection
  of tags and/or contents.
* HTML entity encoding/decoding (example: @é@ to @&eacute;@)
* JS character encoding/decoding (example: @é@ to @\u00E9@)

It originated in these requests on the Plugin Development forum on SourceForge.net:

h2. Installation

===============================================================================================

h3. _Warning_

_*Always* check your Notepad++ version at "? > Debug Info" before installing plugins_
_Notepad++ 8.3 is the *minimum required* version for 64-bit releases of HTML Tag 1.2 and newer_

You can safely use any 32-bit version of HTML Tag with any 32-bit version of Notepad++

===============================================================================================

h3. Plugins Admin

A builtin "plugin manager":pl-admin is available in Notepad++ versions 7.6 and newer.

Find _Plugins_ on the main menu bar and select _Plugins Admin_. Check the box beside _HTML Tag_ and click _Install_.

h3. Manual installation

New plugin versions are added to Plugins Admin only when a new Notepad++ release is published.
To use an updated plugin before release, or downgrade to an earlier version, simply replace the plugin's DLL with another one.

*Note*
_This assumes you have already found a compatible version from a trusted source_

Extract the DLL and accompanying files to the plugins folder under @%ProgramFiles%\Notepad++@ (or wherever you're running Notepad++ from).

For 32-bit versions, make sure the plugin folder is named @HTMLTag_unicode@ and the module is named @HTMLTag_unicode.dll@.
Otherwise, the folder should be named @HTMLTag@ and the module @HTMLTag.dll@.

Right-click on @HTMLTag.dll@ (64-bit), or @HTMLTag_unicode.dll@ (32-bit), and select _Properties_.

If the _Unblock_ option is shown, click the checkbox and click _Apply_, then _OK_:

Restart Notepad++ if it's already running.


h2. Usage

| Ctrl+T | to select the matching tag |
| Ctrl+Shift+T | to select both tags and the entire contents in between |
| Ctrl+Alt+T | to select only the contents between tags |
| Ctrl+E | to encode all selected non-ASCII characters to their HTML entities |
| Ctrl+Alt+E | same as Ctrl+E, but encodes line breaks as well |
| Ctrl+Shift+E | to dEcode all selected HTML entities |
| Alt+J | to encode all selected non-ASCII character to their Javascript entities |
| Alt+Shift+J | to dEcode all selected JS entities |

All commands are available under the Plugins menu item 'HTML Tag'; the shortcut keys can be adjusted
with the shortcut mapper.

h3. To do

* -Add a command to close the open tag at the current location-
  Use the "builtin Notepad++ feature":https://npp-user-manual.org/docs/preferences/#auto-completion
* Add command to encode entities in the contents only (only apply encoding when not inside tags;
  leave valid tags and entities alone)
* Add command to select tags only (and leave the contents out of the selection)
* Make it play nice(r) with PHP & ASP tags (either highlight those separately or ignore them)
* Add option to encode entities 'as-you-type'
* Add option to close tags 'as-you-type' (type '</' and the rest will be inserted automagically)
* "[Request#2147949]":2147949 drop down a list of tags after '<'
* "[Request#2147949]":2147949 drop down a list of attributes on space after a tag
